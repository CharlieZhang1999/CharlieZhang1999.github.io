<h2>Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon</h2>
<i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i> 2023.05 - 2023.08
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Applied Apple’s iOS Edge Saliency Model within the Vision framework supported by Neural Engine to generate
        bounding boxes for salient regions and performed smart cropping on images in Swift.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assessed model performance on more than 1.5k images across diverse image datasets, including selfies, food,
        and landscapes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Developed a visual prototype in XCode showcasing the real-time impact of smart cropping and enabled
        side-by-side comparison with the baseline model. Work submitted to ECCV2018.
    </li>
    <li>
        Conducted comparative analysis among the iOS Edge Saliency Model, the baseline model, and the Amazon
        In-House Saliency Model. Evaluated performance metrics such as latency and IoU score, providing actionable
        insights and suggestions for future enhancements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Uploaded the test beta version to Testflight to ensure the functionality’s accessibility in later builds.
    </li>
</ul>

collaborated with <span class="label">Qian Zhang</span>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Trained a ResNet body-segmentation model on human body images to perform human body segmentation task,
        effectively preprocessing the data and providing as an prior to the 3D body reconstruction project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Creatively harnessed the temporal frames information by integrating propagation module and optical flow
        analysis, resulting in significant enhancement of video segmentation accuracy and the overall IoU score.
    </li>
</ul>
