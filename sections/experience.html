    <ul>
        <li>
            Applied Apple’s iOS Edge Saliency Model within the Vision framework supported by Neural Engine to generate
            bounding boxes for salient regions and performed smart cropping on images in Swift.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assessed model performance on more than 1.5k images across diverse image datasets, including selfies, food,
            and landscapes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed a visual prototype in XCode showcasing the real-time impact of smart cropping and enabled
            side-by-side comparison with the baseline model. Work submitted to ECCV2018.
        </li>
        <li>
            Conducted comparative analysis among the iOS Edge Saliency Model, the baseline model, and the Amazon
            In-House Saliency Model. Evaluated performance metrics such as latency and IoU score, providing actionable
            insights and suggestions for future enhancements.
        </li>
        <li>
            Uploaded the test beta version to Testflight to ensure the functionality’s accessibility in later builds.

            Investigated the estimating of teaching dimension with restricted knowledge to learner’s hypothesis set
            using interactive learning.
        </li>
        <li>
            Proposed a reasonable setting to formulate the problem, and proposed several improvements on the upper and
            lower bound of teaching dimension under this setting
